He was a family man driven by an iron work ethic, and he knew that his German family heritage would play an integral part of his brewery’s success. Today, the sixth generation of Leinenkugel’s continues to brew some of the same family-inspired recipes that Jacob poured his heart and soul into. Over the years, our family has grown and so has our brewery, but our history and heritage remain at the forefront. Our most award-winning beer, Leinenkugel’s Creamy Dark is brewed with a special blend of seven malts for a rich, nutty cocoa flavor and crisp finish. That makes it one deliciously dark, surprisingly smooth brew. Hey, the name says it all.

Banquet is a sessionable, golden lager with an inviting aroma of freshly baked bread and understated hints of banana and pear that’s complemented by an effervescent mouthfeel and a crisp finish. There's a sturdy balance to this American lager. This case of canned beer is the perfect adult beverage for tailgating, barbecues, fishing and hunting trips, garage tinkering, camping and outdoor exploring. Coors' commitment to quality is unwavering: from brewing using only 100% Rocky Mountain water and ingredients like high country Moravian barley, to malting in-house to ensure consistency from grain to glass. Pair Coors Banquet with everyday favorite fare - burgers, BBQ and wings. Coors Banquet is the result of conviction and tradition – one that can be traced back for more than 140 years."},

In 1838, several of the more enthusiastic brewers in town declared 36 barrels undrinkable and dumped them out in front of the town hall. This drove the brewing households to join forces and collectively build a brewery -- The Citizens Brewery of Plzen. The idea was to create a state of the art brewery to put in place a series of new beer making practices that were making their way across central Europe, such as the production of pale malt.

All of the Salice Salentino are made with a combination of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera di Lecce. This wine has 80% Negroamaro (=black and bitter) and 20% Malvasia Nera di Lecce.\nLiante refers to the Levanter wind, freezing in winter and hot in summer, which blows hard and consistently through our vineyards, acting as a natural mould deterrent. This wine is softened by the addition of Malvasia Nera di Lecce, endowing it with velvety, creamy flavour, the perfect partner for the freshness of Negroamaro.\nThe grapes are harvested very early in the morning and immediately crushed. The grapes are fermented at a controlled temperature in stainless steel vats, with 10–12 days’ maceration and scheduled pumping\nover.

Fermentation takes place in thermo-conditioned vats at a controlled temperature. Maceration lasts for about 8 days. First racking is done when the product is almost completely dry. The wine ages in traditional Slavonian oak barrels that make it harmonious and enhance the elegance of the bouquet.

Today, the Barbi “Blue Label”, created in 1958, is one of the most widely recognized Brunello labels in the world.","prodShortDesc":"This Brunello di Montalcino is produced since 1892 and was awarded many times for its quality. This wine is the “heart” of the Fattoria dei Barbi production and it is made with 100% Sangiovese grapes.\nfrom our best vineyards in Montalcino.\nThe winery is owned by the same family, the Cinelli-Colombini family, for more than 25 generations and this wine has the same label since the 1958. It was created by Giovanni Cinelli-Colombini. In the winery there are more than 130 back vintages of Brunello Blue Label.\nBefore the fermentation the grapes are subjected to a cold pre-fermentative maceration which consists in cooling the grapes. This process increases the extraction of polyphenols and aroma compounds.  The regular alcoholic fermentation follows and lasts 16/17 days at a controlled temperature. After the racking and the malolactic fermentation the wine ages in small-medium size oak barrels (2,25 – 15 hl) for the first months. Later it completes the aging in larger oak barrels, for a total period of two years and then is bottled at least 4 months before the release.\nBrilliant ruby red color with a touch of garnet. Intense aromas of ripe cherry rounded by scents of citrus and spices, wild herbs and earthy hues. The palate is soft and balanced with delicate tannins, vibrant acidity and a long persistency.\nThis wine is perfect for important dishes, roasted or grilled red meats, game, venison, stewed wild boar. Excellent with mature cheeses. The best expression is reached when served at a temperature\nof 64-65F.\nThe Cinelli-Colombini family was the first one of all Tuscany to export the wines in the nited States back in the 1960.\n92pts Wine Spectator; 91pts Wine Enthusast; 94pts Wine Advocate","prodLongDesc":"Fattoria dei Barbi is among the original producers of Brunello di Montalcino with bottles dating back to the 1892. Since its first vintages, the estate has received top awards at exhibitions all over Europe and was the first to export Brunello to the USA in 1962.
